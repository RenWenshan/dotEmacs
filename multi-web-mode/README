1. Introduction

   Multi Web Mode is a minor mode wich makes web editing in Emacs much
   easier.

   Basically what it does is select the appropiate major mode
   automatically when you move the point and also calculates the
   correct indentation of chunks according to the indentation of the
   most relevant major mode.

   Currently it is more focused to work on buffers which contain html,
   css, javascript and php, but adding other modes is really simple:
   you just need to add your own mode to the `mweb-tags'. You can do
   that by using M-x customize-group RET multi-web-mode and looking
   for the `mweb-tags' variable.

   If you wish a major-mode or extra to be included in the default
   package please let me know.

2. Requirements

   You don't need any special libraries to run this package since it
   includes already all the necessary major-modes and extras.

   Regarding the version of Emacs, this package was tested successfully
   with 23.0.60.

3. Installation

   To install Multi Web Mode just put
   (load "<path-to-multiweb-mode>/load.el") in your .emacs file and
   you are done.

   Restart Emacs or use M-x load-file ~/.emacs.

4. Usage

   Multi Web Mode binds the following keystrokes:

   M-<f11> : Prompts the user to override the default major mode.

   M-<f12> : Prompts the user to override the calculated extra indentation.

   [tab] : Is bound to `mweb-indent'.

   [backtab] : Deletes indentation, useful when magic indentation
   `mweb-submodes-magic-indent' is nil. It deletes the number of spaces
   defined in `mweb-default-submode-indent-offset'.

5. Included packages
